/**
The contents of the partials directory should contain functionality, utilities, mixins, variables
and functions that are used by both globally scoped or locally scoped style files but do not
represent CSS that needs to be transpiled as a standalone file.

This file should forward all of the various files or modules in the directory such that they can be
referenced under the same "partials" namespace.

In order to avoid stylesheet import issues, it is very important that the imports within this module
are directional.  The import patterns should be structured as follows:

1. Files in the `functions` module cannot import from either the `mixins` or the `variables` module.
2. Files in the `variables` module can import from the `functions` module but not the `mixins`
   module.
3. Files in the `mixins` module can import from both the `functions` and the `variables` module.

This in effect gives a unidirectional import pattern as:

  functions -> variables -> mixins

Breaking this pattern will result in SASS import errors due to files outside of the partials module
importing the partials directory.
